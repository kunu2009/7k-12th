    summary: "Economics is divided into Microeconomics, which studies individual economic units like households and firms, and Macroeconomics, which examines the economy as a whole, including aggregates like inflation, unemployment, and national income. Microeconomics uses a slicing method, focusing on price theory and individual behavior. Macroeconomics uses a lumping method, focusing on income theory and aggregate variables. Both branches are interdependent and crucial for understanding the complexities of economic systems.",

    summary: "Utility analysis is a cornerstone of consumer behavior theory. It defines 'utility' as the want-satisfying power of a commodity. The core concept is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility (DMU), which states that the additional satisfaction (marginal utility) a consumer gets from consuming successive units of a commodity goes on diminishing. This law, proposed by Alfred Marshall, is based on assumptions of rationality, cardinal measurement of utility, and continuous consumption. It has significant practical applications in explaining the paradox of value, forming the basis for the law of demand, and guiding fiscal policy.",

    summary: "Supply analysis examines the behavior of producers. 'Supply' refers to the quantity of a commodity that a producer is willing and able to offer for sale at a given price. The Law of Supply posits a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied, meaning producers are willing to sell more at higher prices. This results in an upward-sloping supply curve. A change in price causes a movement along the supply curve (expansion or contraction), while changes in other determinants—such as technology, input prices, or government policies—cause the entire curve to shift (increase or decrease). The concept of 'Cost and Revenue' is central, with Total Cost (TC), Average Cost (AC), and Marginal Cost (MC) influencing supply decisions. Revenue concepts include Total Revenue (TR), Average Revenue (AR), and Marginal Revenue (MR). Producers aim to maximize profit, which is the difference between total revenue and total cost.",
